Authors : Samia OUAKRIM, Ladji Idrissa FOFANA and Fatima-Ezzahra FETTAH

This challenge was done as a project for the Master 2 Data Science (2022/2023), DATACAMP course

## Introduction

In the Telecom Industry, many subscriptions can be ended or canceled, which is known as churn. If there are no subscriptions, a customer churns when they stop using the service. The main goal of this project is to reduce customer churn , this is equivalent to increase customer retention, the terms being interchangeable to a large degree

This project aims at constructing a machine learning model capable at predicting accurately Customer Churn Rate.



## Getting started

### Install

To run a submission and the notebook you will need the dependencies listed
in `requirements.txt`. You can install install the dependencies with the
following command-line:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using `conda`, we provide an `environment.yml` file for similar
usage.

### Challenge description

Get started with the [dedicated notebook](phone_operator_starting_kit.ipynb)


### Test a submission

The submissions need to be located in the `submissions` folder. 

To run a specific submission, you can use the `ramp-test` command line:

```bash
ramp-test --submission my_submission
```

You can get more information regarding this command line:

```bash
ramp-test --help
```

### To go further

You can find more information regarding `ramp-workflow` in the
[dedicated documentation](https://paris-saclay-cds.github.io/ramp-docs/ramp-workflow/stable/using_kits.html)
